## About

DemoMonkey allows you to turn your software demo in a fully tailored demo for your prospect in minutes:
You simply provide text & visual replacements for your application's UI and DemoMonkey turns your generic
demo into a personalised experience for your audience.

## Installation

To add the latest version as extension to chrome, use the following link:

<https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/demomonkey/jgbhioialphpgjgofopnplfibkeehgjd>

To use a pre-release version, you can also switch to the developer channel:

<https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/demomonkey-dev-channel/dgmdcddamkccpmefapgabnafjhhcdhdh>

## Usage

DemoMonkey is driven by **configurations**, that contain replace patterns in the following format:

```ini
eCommerce = Booking Service
Checkout = Book flight
```

This is the most simple format. The configurations are parsed as ini files, so you can use sections and comments for structure:

```ini
[Frontend]
; Change the main domain
shop.example.com = fly.example.org
; cities
San Francisco = Berlin
New York = London
```

Additionally you have commands for complex replacements, variables and imports for improved reusability and options for
changing the behavior of your demo monkey:

```ini
; Commands are introduced by '!'. For example you can use regular expressions:
!/Order/i = Flight

; Variables are introduced by '$', have a default value and a description
$domain = example.com//Set the name of your customer
api.payment.com = payment.$customer

; Imports are introduced by '+'. They allow you to load replacements from other configurations.
; For example you can externalize the replacements for cities and reuse it over and over again.
+GermanCities

; Options are introduced by '@'. You can use them to change the behavior of tampermonkey.
; A common use case is introducing include and exclude rules for domains:
@include =
@exclude =
```

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for a more comprehensive guide.
